  audio-rate transitions, and HDR/SDR color handling.
- Deferred automatic-updater initialization until playback is idle and moved
  screenshot encoding and file writes off the main thread.
- Established the standalone Khua public repository.
- Added reproducible local builds, bundle verification, App Store project
  configuration, privacy metadata, licensing material, and app icon assets.
- Expanded the interface from English and Simplified Chinese to 17 locales,
  with data-driven language selection and explicit English fallback behavior.
- Fixed language-menu state handling and made status chips size themselves to
  translated text instead of truncating longer locales.
- Added configuration-gated Sparkle support for future direct distribution.
  Mac App Store builds compile out the updater and exclude the framework.

  builds; users can turn the default-on behavior off at any time.

  Dock access to recent media.

  duplicate-file focusing.

  transactional subtitle loading with recovery safeguards.

  indexing, bounded panel warming, and foreground-I/O yielding.

  resume positions.
- Added bounded welcome-list volume warming and hover-driven file prefetching
  for direct builds, with foreground playback priority and no cloud downloads.

  Welcome windows present a standalone panel; clearing history discards cached
  panel directories across all windows.

  smooth software gain, and stereo-linked peak protection.
- Refined the playback controls with localized accessibility labels, responsive
  timeline and button feedback, and Reduce Motion fallbacks.

  setup and restore offers. Sandboxed App Store builds omit these controls.

  warming, priority-aware prefetching, and a lightweight opening indicator.

- Improved playback reliability across seeking, end-of-file transitions, audio
  recovery, thumbnails, HDR color metadata, AV1 decoding, and asynchronous
  frame presentation.
